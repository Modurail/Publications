# Framework


## Framework: General
The specifications for module sizes are relatively strict. The following describes the minimum requirements and recommended practices for module framework construction. Modules will be checked annually to ensure conformance to specifications following the **NGM** Module Compliance Audit Form. Conforming modules will display a dated sticker which will provide sufficient proof of compliance.

As of this revision, the **NGM** standards committee has not approved the use of transition modules to allow for the inclusion of non-conforming modules.

## Framework: Requirements
For consistency with existing modules, module frame sides and ends shall be made with 1x4 lumber[^FW1] (¾" x 3 ½" finished) such as common pine or high quality plywood. It shall be straight, solid and free of knots, sanded smooth prior to finishing and painting. All visible framework shall be painted with Ace Hardware Forest Green interior latex paint (or approved equivalent). Some provision must be provided for hanging NGM provided decorative curtain or skirting on both outside and inside facing frames.[^FW2]

Modules are joined by 3" C-clamps. Provision must be made to clamp to any other module whose side frame is a standard 1x4. Two clamps are required for each module end and are typically provided by the club. Two clamps are required to allow front to back track alignment.

[^FW1]: Note that if Tortoise© switch machines are to be installed, standard 1x4 lumber will not provide adequate depth to protect them from damage.
[^FW2]: A 3/4" Velcro© strip (hook side) is recommended.

### Frame Dimensions
| **Dimension** | **Min.** | **Max.** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Leg Height | N/A | Adjust with eye bolt to reach 40" at rail.[^FW3] |
| Length | 24" | 96" (in 24" increments) |
| Depth | 18" | 36" |
| Height | 3 ½" | N/A |

Frame corners must be square.

[^FW3]: Must be adjustable from 39" to 41". See Diagram **D-2** (Leg Construction) for details.

### Framework: Recommended Practices
* Frame pieces shall be joined with screws and glue.
* Only glue on the inside of the framework to eliminate visible residue from the frame exterior.
* If a handle is attached to the module, it shall be on the north side of the module (inside face).
* Legs should be removable and have a T-nut or threaded insert and eye bolt installed on the floor side to allow for rail height adjustments.
