# Introduction
This document describes the standards, requirements and recommended practices of the **North Georgia Modurail** group (**NGM**). It documents the requirements a module must meet to interchange with other **NGM** modules.

An **NGM** module is a lightweight, portable, interchangeable section of a larger layout that, when assembled together, forms a layout capable of handling continuously running trains. While mated modules are common, individual modules are considered to be stand-alone dioramas that may be placed anywhere in the layout.

The intent of these standards is to allow a wide range of individual expression while providing a vehicle for model railroaders to get together to run trains. It provides an excellent method for those with novice skills to learn from more experienced modelers through workshops and operating sessions. It provides a method with which to promote the fellowship of the hobby and to spark an interest in those who don't have their own home layout.
