# Scenery
1. The scenery design, style, colors and details are at the module owner's discretion.

2. Each module may be a stand-alone diorama or belong to a set of modules that make up a mated set.

3. The club does not mandate scenery styles nor contents.

4. As a general guideline, a majority of **NGM** modelers follow a modern, late 1960's to 90's theme.

## Backboard
1. Each module will have a backboard (sky board) that extends 14" above the rear side rail.

2. It shall be 1/8" shorter than the module on each end to avoid interference with adjoining modules.

3. The backboard may be permanently attached but is recommended that it be removable for ease of transportation and exhibit flexibility.[^SC01] (See diagram D-3 for placement.)

4. The bottom of the backboard shall provide sufficient clearance for attaching the decorative skirting.

5. The backboard must be painted on both sides. **NGM** recommends Sherwin Williams Universe Blue (or approved equivalent) for the front (outside face) of the backboard.

6. Paint the inside face of the backboard with the same green paint used for the frame (refer to section 5.2.)

[^SC01]: The layout coordinator will decide if backboards are optional or mandatory, given the requirements of a specific display or exhibit.
