### Wiring Color Code Specification ES 1.0
| **Wire Connection** | **Wire Color** | **Anderson Housing**[^ES11] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| S. Main, S. Rail | RED | 1327 Red |
| S. Main, N. Rail | GRN | 1327G5 Green |
| N. Main, S. Rail | BLU | 1327G8 Blue |
| N. Main, N. Rail | YEL | 1327G16 Yellow |
| Aux. Main, S. Rail | ORG | 1327G17 Orange |
| Aux. Main, N. Rail | BRN | 1327G23 Violet[^ES1] |
| DCC Common | GRY | 1327G18 Gray |
| 16VAC-1 | BLK | 1327G6 Black |
| 16VAC-2 | WHT| 1327G7 White |

[^ES1]: 1327G21 Brown is allowed, but not recommended due to poor color contrast with Black.
[^ES11]: The housing color prefix is the Anderson PowerPole manufacturer ID for the shell.

### Wire and Plug Specifications ES 1.1
| **Item** | **NGM Standard** |
| :--- | :--- |
| Throttle Bus Wire | LocoNet[^ES2] |
| Throttle Bus Plug | RJ25 Plug |
| Throttle Bus Socket[^ES3] | RJ25 Socket (jack)[^ES4] |
| Feeder Wire | 16-20 AWG |
| Main Electrical Bus Wire | 14 AWG |
| Left (West) Connector | Mounted 'M' |
| Right (East) Connector | Mounted 'M'[^ES5] |

[^ES2]: 6 wire flat phone cable. **Do not use twisted pair cable for LocoNet.**
[^ES3]: RJ25 is a 6P6C connection and at least one is required mounted on the front face (recommended on the East end).
[^ES4]: The Digitrax UP5 is recommended.
[^ES5]: Optional extension cable terminated by a 'J' connector extending at least 18" beyond the module end.

### AC Power Source Specifications ES 1.2
| **Item** | **NGM Standard** |
| :--- | :--- |
| Type | 16VAC tap from Main Electrical Bus |
| Capacity | 500 mA draw max. [^ES6] |
| Wire Size (min) | 14 AWG on bus, 20 AWG on module[^ES7] |

[^ES6]: Maximum current available to any one module is subject to total current capacity provided by the power district. See layout coordinator for details or exceptions.
[^ES7]: Used for local, short length track feeders.

## Electrical Reference


### General Electrical Standards
Each module shall provide and connect to a 14 AWG Main Electrical Bus and shall be wired according to the diagram provided in this document. Branchlines should be isolated from the mainline with plastic insulating rail joiners.

### Wiring
1. The Main Electrical Bus shall consist of a nine (9) wire 14 AWG cable forming a robust electrical backbone mounted on each module and connected to adjoining modules by jumpers.

2. This cable shall provide power as follows:
    
    1. two (2) wire pairs to power the mainlines,
    
    2. one (1) wire pair to power the auxiliary mainline,
    
    3. one (1) wire pair to provide 16VAC for local accessory power needs,
    
    4. one (1) single wire to serve as the DCC booster common.  (See diagram **D-5** for pin wiring and color code.)

3. Modules shall provide continuous connections for LocoNet even if not needed on the module.[^ES10]

4. Provisions should be made to ensure that all wiring can be properly stowed for transport (avoid loose hanging wires and connectors).

[^ES10]: Use either an approved RJ25 (6P6C) inline coupler or a UP-5 'daisy-chain'.

### Connections


#### Terminal Strips
All module wiring shall be accessible using a terminal strip between the Main Electrical Bus and the rest of the module. This will allow for easy maintenance, the ability to add non-standard plug assemblies and provide a convenient location for electrical testing.

#### Main Electrical Bus Connectors
1. Bus connections between modules shall use Anderson PowerPole connectors arranged in 3x3 blocks in one of two configurations, 'M' for mounting on a module and 'J' for jumpers between modules or extensions. ('M' blocks connect only to 'J' blocks and vice versa.)

2. Connector shell colors shall correspond to the recommended wire colors.[^ES8]

3. The 'M' connection blocks shall be securely mounted within 8" of the module end and within 6" of the front of the module. If an extension cable is used in place of a mounted 'M' connector, it shall extend at least 18" beyond the East end (right side) of the module.

4. Local wiring (track feeders and AC accessory) shall tap from the 'M' connector block on the West end (left side) and terminate in a nearby terminal strip.

5. **NGM** will stock the connector housings, contacts and wire for use in members' modules at a nominal fee.

[^ES8]: Exception to allow a Violet housing to substitute for Brown to improve color contrast.

### Provision for Accessory Power
The Main Electrical Bus shall provide 16VAC on the black and white wires. Individual modules may use this power source for optional accessories such as lighting, animation and switch machines. Each module is limited to 500 mA current draw, continuous.[^ES9]

[^ES9]: Exceptions to this limit may be made by the layout coordinator.
