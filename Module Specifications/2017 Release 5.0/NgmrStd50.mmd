# Introduction

This document describes the standards, requirements and recommended
practices of the **North Georgia Modurail** group. It documents the
requirements a module must meet to interchange with other **NGM**
modules.

An **NGM** module is a lightweight, portable, interchangeable section of
a larger layout that, when assembled together, forms a layout capable of
handling continuously running trains. While mated modules are common,
individual modules are considered to be stand-alone dioramas that may be
placed anywhere in the layout.

The intent of the these standards is to allow a wide range of individual
expression while providing a vehicle for model railroaders to get
together to run trains. It provides an excellent method for those with
novice skills to learn from the more experienced through workshops and
operating sessions. It provides a method with which to promote the
fellowship of the hobby and to spark an interest in those who feel they
haven't the room for a layout in their home.
