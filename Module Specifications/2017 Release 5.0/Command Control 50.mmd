# Command Control Overview

The **NMRA** Electrical Committee: Digital Command Control Working Group
has developed a set of standards and recommended practices that define
digital command control so that basic interchange of equipment can be
obtained between users of different manufacturers of digital command
control equipment.

Digital Command Control (**DCC**) is possible because of new advances in
electronics that allow a very smart controller to be installed inside
the average locomotive shell. Instead of using a variable power source
as in the case of a standard analog throttle, the track becomes a
communications device that broadcasts multiple signals from many
controllers at once. Each locomotive receiver is pre-programmed to
respond to a specific controller, allowing many locomotives on the same
section of track, each controlled independently.

The analog throttle we commonly refer to as a *power pack* is now inside
the locomotive. As a result, the track will always have between 7 and 20
volts available across it when measured with a voltmeter. While most
non-decoder equipped locomotives will operate with this system, **NGM**
cannot guarantee that damage will not result from this use.

The **DCC** standard allows compatibility between different
manufacturers while at the same time allowing the manufacturer a great
deal of freedom and flexibility to create very different products to
fill market niches that they feel best qualified to provide.

**North Georgia Modurail, Inc**. has enthusiastically adopted these
standards by purchasing command stations, boosters, decoders and
throttles from **Digitrax, Inc**. of Norcross, Georgia. **Digitrax**
units are compatible with **NMRA** **DCC** Standards and Recommended
Practices[^14], while still offering additional options and features.

[^14]: Due to standardization, decoders from other **DCC** compatible
    manufacturers will work with the club system but extended optional
    features may not operate.

# Command Control Bus Wiring

It is strongly recommended that all new **NGM** modules provide support
for the Throttle Bus. If the module owner would like, **NGM** will
install a socket mounted RJ11-6 jack on either/both the north and/or
south faces of the module along with the associated wiring to interface
to the Throttle Bus.

## Power Pack Isolation

Sections of track that will operate in analog mode (using a standard
power pack), should provide some form of isolation. The most common
technique is to install a \#1156 30W, 12V automotive tail lamp between
adjoining track sections (*see diagram **D-5***.)

# Command Control Terms and Definitions

The purpose of this section is to define the nomenclature used in
discussing Digital Command Control (**DCC**). **DCC** can be assumed to
imply compatibility with **NMRA DCC** Standards and Recommended
Practices.

## Control Bus

A bus which connects a Command Station to its Boosters.

## Cab Bus

A bus used to connect all types of cabs, except wireless cabs, to a
command station. Wireless cabs are indirectly connected to a cab bus via
their companion wireless cab base.

## Booster

A unit which accepts as input a signal from a command station and
provides as output a power source onto which is encoded a digital
(**DCC**) packet signal. (Also known as a "Power Station". **Digitrax**
calls it a **DB100**, for example.) More than one booster may be used on
the same layout if additional current is needed for locomotives.

## Cab

A unit which presents to a human operator the controls necessary to
operate a model locomotive, track switches, or layout accessories. Such
controls may include both input devices (knobs, buttons, switches)and
output devices (lamps, displays, audible sounding units).

## Fixed Cab

A cab which is permanently mounted in a specific location.

## Tethered Cab

A cab which is hand-held and connected by a fixed cable to the layout.

## Walk-around Cab

A cab which is hand-held and connected by a cable to a plug which may be
inserted in jacks at multiple points around the layout. Walk-around cabs
permit the locomotive(s) being controlled by that cab to maintain
direction and speed during the interval while the cab is unplugged,
moved to a new location, and re-plugged. This is because packet
transmission is done in the command station.

## Wireless Cab

A hand-held cab which has no cable connection to the layout. Wireless
cabs may use infra-red, radio, or other means of communicating
information.

## Wireless Cab Base

A companion receptor unit for one or more wireless cabs which is fixed
to the layout and presents cab information to the cab bus

## Computerized Cab

A cab which is implemented by a personal computer or workstation.

## Panel or Tower Cab

A fixed cab which is primarily used for operating turnouts, signals, and
related track accessories. A tower cab may, but typically does not, also
control locomotives. Tower panels typically include display devices for
indicating track switch positions, track occupancy, and layout status. A
**CTC** board is an example of a tower cab.

## Command Station

That unit which *accepts* input from all cabs currently in use and
provides as output either:

1.  a **DCC** signal directly to the track, or
2.  an appropriate signal to drive a Booster to output a **DCC** signal.

## Software Command Station

A command station implemented by software processes in a computer,
typically a personal computer or workstation.

## Accessory Booster

A Booster whose output is dedicated to the operation of stationary
decoders.

## Programmer

That unit which provides access to the system configuration functions,
such as setting locomotive addresses, combining and breaking up multiple
unit lashups, etc. May be integrated with the command station, or with
one or more cabs.

## Decoder

A unit which accepts address and command information presented in the
digital packet format from a Command Station or Booster and directly
controls and drives a motor, solenoid, relay, lamp, or other device.
(Also known as a "Receiver".)

## Mobile Decoder

A decoder which is installed in, and implements the specific functions
to drive the motor, lamps, and accessories of a locomotive or other
piece of rolling stock. A mobile decoder derives its signal and power
from contact with the rails.

## Stationary Decoder

A decoder which is installed in a fixed place on the layout and provides
power and position control for one or more turnout motors or provides
operational control for other stationary accessories on the layout. A
stationary decoder may derive its signal and power from the rails or it
may be powered from an Accessory Booster.

## Decoder Slave

A unit which is driven by a decoder and which provides additional power
for the operation of additional electrical load in parallel with the
original decoder load. Typical use is for 2^nd^, 3^rd^, etc. motors in a
multi-motor locomotive or permanently-coupled locomotives. May also be
called "Slave Decoder".

## Track Segment

That portion of electrically isolated track powered and controlled by a
single Booster.

## Bus

A set of wires that distributes electrical power or signals around the
layout.

## Track Bus

A bus which connects a power station to a track segment. The aggregate
length of the track segment is limited such that the power station can
power the maximum number of locomotives to be simultaneously operated on
the segment. Note that stationary decoders may be connected to a track
bus. The wire gauge of a track bus must be appropriate to the rating of
the associated Booster.
