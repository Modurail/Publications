# NGM Module Track Work Standards Sheets

The **NMRA** Standards printed here are taken from published **NMRA**
Standards **MS-1.0**, Revised Jan, 1990. The **NGM** Standards are
derived from the **Piedmont Division Standards** and have been modified
to suit the operating conditions of **NGM**.

# Track Work Reference

The following track work information applies to all **NGM** modules.
They apply regardless of size or type.

## Track Work: Requirements

To be compatible with existing **NGM** modules, it is a requirement that
one adhere to **either** the **NMRA** Standard **or** the **NGM**
Standard.

## Switch Machine

Manual ground throws or electrical switch machines may be used to
control switch position. The only requirement is that all switch devices
shall positively lock the switch machine in either position when set.

## Mainlines

Two mainlines shall be required, located as shown in diagram **D-1**.
The club is supportive of modules that provide an auxiliary mainline but
it is not required.

## Module Interface Tracks

9" standard **Snap-Track** sections will be used on interface areas that
use the **NMRA** standard 4 ½" interface area. 3" and 6" sections will
be used to connect **NGM** to **NGM** modules and **NGM** to **NMRA**
modules respectively.

# Track Work: Recommended Practices


## Uncouplers

**Kadee's** \#307 (switched) electromagnetic uncoupler (or equivalent)
is acceptable on the mainline tracks, so long as it is properly
installed and does not interfere with the passage of trains.

## Through Tracks

The minimum required number of through tracks is 2. An auxiliary through
track should be considered to allow for a third mainline. When providing
information about your module, please be sure to provide the auxiliary
track type, that is, Mainline \#3 or branch line. Providing for the
third mainline remains optional.

## Transition

Use of code 83 rail or smaller should have a 2 ½" transition track
before meeting with mainline code 100 rail. (*Transition should not
occur at a switch joint*.)

## Switches

Switches with positive locking action are preferred over the more common
slide action switches. This style mechanism is most commonly found on
switches made by **PECO**. If a switch without positive lock is
installed, it is highly recommended that it be driven by a switch
machine that resists accidental movement; for example, a Tortoise© motor
driven switch machine.
