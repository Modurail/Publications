# Notes on Release 4.1
* Rob was unable to locate the source file (Word document) for Release 4.1, only the generated PDF (published version since October, 2000).
* After a careful review and comparison of 4.0 and 4.1, Rob determined there are no content differences between 4.0 and 4.1; only some formatting.

# Diagrams
* Within the Diagrams folder are subfolders corresponding to the diagram reference number.
* Rob recalls the original drawings were designed in a CAD program (don't recall which one), then saved as WMF (Windows Media File) for ease of embedding into a Word document.
* Only the WMF versions are included as the DWG originals were not found (except for earlier versions).
* D-4 Corner Dimensions diagram cannot be located.

# Other Images
* The NGM logo and other images which may be needed are in the Media Assets folder of the root directoy.
