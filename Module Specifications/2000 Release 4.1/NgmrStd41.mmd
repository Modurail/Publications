# Introduction

This document describes the standards, requirements and recommended
practices of the **North Georgia Modurail** group. It documents the
requirements a module must meet to interchange with other **NGM**
modules.

An **NGM** module is a lightweight, portable, interchangeable section of
a larger layout that, when assembled together, forms a layout capable of
handling continuously running trains. While mated modules are common,
individual modules are considered to be stand-alone dioramas that may be
placed anywhere in the layout.

The intent of the these standards is to allow a wide range of individual
expression while providing a vehicle for model railroaders to get
together to run trains. It provides an excellent method for those with
novice skills to learn from the more experienced through workshops and
operating sessions. It provides a method with which to promote the
fellowship of the hobby and to spark an interest in those who feel they
haven't the room for a layout in their home.

## Track Work Reference

The following track work information applies to all **NGM** modules.
They apply regardless of size or type.

### Track Work: Requirements

To be compatible with existing **NGM** modules, it is a requirement that
one adhere to **either** the **NMRA** Standard **or** the **NGM**
Standard.

### Switch Machine

Manual ground throws or electrical switch machines may be used to
control switch position. The only requirement is that all switch devices
shall positively lock the switch machine in either position when set.

### Mainlines

Two mainlines shall be required, located as shown in diagram **D-1**.
The club is supportive of modules that provide an auxiliary mainline but
it is not required.

### Module Interface Tracks

9" standard **Snap-Track** sections will be used on interface areas that
use the **NMRA** standard 4 ½" interface area. 3" and 6" sections will
be used to connect **NGM** to **NGM** modules and **NGM** to **NMRA**
modules respectively.

## Track Work: Recommended Practices


### Uncouplers

**Kadee's** \#307 (switched) electromagnetic uncoupler (or equivalent)
is acceptable on the mainline tracks, so long as it is properly
installed and does not interfere with the passage of trains.

### Through Tracks

The minimum required number of through tracks is 2. An auxiliary through
track should be considered to allow for a third mainline. When providing
information about your module, please be sure to provide the auxiliary
track type, that is, Mainline \#3 or branch line. Providing for the
third mainline remains optional.

### Transition

Use of code 83 rail or smaller should have a 2 ½" transition track
before meeting with mainline code 100 rail. (*Transition should not
occur at a switch joint*.)

### Switches

Switches with positive locking action are preferred over the more common
slide action switches. This style mechanism is most commonly found on
switches made by **PECO**. If a switch without positive lock is
installed, it is highly recommended that it be driven by a switch
machine that resists accidental movement; for example, a Tortoise© motor
driven switch machine.

## Electrical Reference


### General Electrical Standards

Each module shall connect to the Main Electrical Bus via the ATA 9-Pin
connector providing power for at least two mainlines and shall be wired
according to the wiring diagram provided in this document. It is not
required that mainlines have module to module isolation but branchlines
should be isolated from the mainline with plastic insulating rail
joiners.

An **NGM** modification to the **NMRA** standard for Main Electrical Bus
Wiring is the use of 14 AWG electrical wire on HO modules. This wire
size allows for high current capacity, low signal loss, and high
physical strength. (*See **NMRA Standard MS 1.3** Electrical standards
for Modules, All Scales.*)

### Wiring

The Main Electrical Bus shall consist of a nine (9) wire cable forming a
robust electrical backbone to which each module is connected by feeders.
This cable shall provide three (3) pairs of 14 AWG wire to power two (2)
mainlines and one (1) auxiliary mainline, one (1) 14 AWG wire to serve
as the DCC booster common and one (1) pair of 14 AWG wires to provide
18VAC. Each module need only provide wiring for local track and power
requirements, *(see diagram **D-6** for pin wiring and color code.)*

Throttle Bus wiring will be provided and installed by **NGM** if
requested.

Provisions should be made to ensure that all wiring can be properly
stowed for transport. In other words, no dangling wires.

### Connections


#### Terminal Strips

It is recommended that all module wiring be accessible using a terminal
strip between the 9-pin connector and the rest of the module. This will
allow for easy socket maintenance, the ability to easily add **NMRA**
plug assemblies and also provide a convenient location for electrical
testing with a voltmeter.

#### Main Electrical Bus Connectors

The ATA 9-pin socket shall be mounted towards the back of and as close
to center (East-West) as possible on modules up to 6' long. On longer
modules the socket shall be mounted 3' from the West end (closest joist
is acceptable.) Use a mounting bracket (Pollock \#12-701) and orient the
socket facing downward as much as possible giving proper clearance for
exit wires and not allowing the connector to hang below the module
frame.

**NGM** will stock these connectors and wire for use in members' modules
at a nominal fee.

#### Plug Adapters

When connecting to a standard **NMRA** module, an adapter must be used
to break out the individual mainlines into the 2-pin plugs used by
**NMRA**. It is intended that **NGM** will have these adapters available
to members who have followed the **NMRA** standards. *This would be the
case if a new member joined with an existing module from another club.*

### Branch Line Electrical Isolation

Optional sidings and passing tracks must be electrically isolated if
analog throttles are used for switching off the mainline. Gaps must be
installed on both rails. Common-rail wiring is not to be used. Any local
controls should be mounted on the module. Removable control panels are
permissible. *(See Branchline Power Connection Diagram **D-5**.)*

The use of plastic rail joiners is preferred over the cut and fill
method (using epoxy to fill a cut in the rails) when installing
insulation gaps.

### Provision for Accessory Power

The Main Electrical Bus shall provide 18 VAC on the black and white
wires. Individual modules may use this power source for optional
accessories such as lighting, animation and switch machines. It is
recommended that a module limit the current draw to 500 mA, continuous.

# Frame Work


## Framework: General

The specifications for module sizes are relatively strict. The following
describes the minimum requirements and recommended practices for module
framework construction. Modules will be checked annually to ensure
conformance to specifications following the **NGM** Module Compliance
Audit Form. Conforming modules will display a dated sticker which will
provide sufficient proof of compliance.

As of this revision, the **NGM** standards committee has not approved
the use of transition modules to allow for the inclusion of
non-conforming modules.

## Framework: Requirements

For consistency with existing modules, it is recommended the module
frame sides and ends will be made with 1" x 4" (^3^/~4~" x 3½" finished
[^11]) lumber such as common pine. It shall be straight, solid and free
of knots. It shall be sanded smooth prior to finishing and painting. All
visible framework must be painted with Ace Hardware Forest Green
interior latex paint (or equivalent.) Some provision must be provided
for hanging NGM provided decorative curtain or skirting.[^12]

Modules are joined by 3" C-clamps. Provision must be made to clamp to
any other module whose side frame is a standard 1" x 4". Two clamps are
required for each module end and none will be provided by the club. Two
clamps are required to allow front to back track alignment.

[^11]: Note that if Tortoise© switch machines are to be installed
    standard 1" x 4" lumber will not provide adequate depth to protect
    them from damage.

[^12]: A ¾" Velcro© strip (hook side) is recommended.

### Frame Dimensions

| Dimension | Min. | Max. |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **Leg Height** | N/A | Adjust with eye bolt to reach 40" at rail [^13] 
                                                    
   *See Diagram **D-2** (Leg Construction)* |
| **Length** | 24" | 96" (in 24" increments) |
| **Depth** | 18" | 36" |
| **Height** | 3 ½" | N/A |

Frame corners must be square

[^13]: Must be adjustable from 39" to 41".

### Framework: Recommended Practices

It is recommended that the frame pieces be joined with screws and glue.
It is also recommended that the gluing be done on the inside of the
framework to eliminate glue residue from marring the appearance of the
frame exterior.

If a handle is attached to the module, it should be done on the north
side so that it is not seen during shows. The legs should be removable
and have a T-nut or threaded insert and eye bolt installed on the floor
side to allow for rail height adjustments.

# Scenery


## General

The scenery design, style, colors and details are all optional. Each
module has the option of being a stand alone diorama or belonging to a
set of modules that make up a mated set. The club will not mandate
scenery styles nor scenery contents. As a general guideline, a clear
majority of **NGM** modelers have followed a modern, late 1960's to 90's
theme.

## Sky Board

Each module will have a sky board or backboard that extends 14" above
the rear side rail. It should be 1/8" shorter than the module on each
end to avoid interference with adjoining modules. The sky board may be
permanently attached but it is recommended that it be removable for ease
of transportation. *(See diagram **D-3** for placement.)* The sky board
must be painted on both sides. **NGM** recommends the use of Sherwin
Williams Universe Blue (or equivalent) for the front of the sky board.
Paint the back of the sky board with the same green paint used for the
frame *(refer to section **3.1**.)*

# Rolling Stock


## Cars and Equipment

The requirements for rolling stock which will be used during a specific
setup of the layout may be determined in advance by the setup
coordinator. If equipment being used on the layout is performing in a
manner deemed by the setup coordinator to not be sufficiently reliable,
he/she may order it removed from the layout until the condition has been
corrected.

## Coupler Type: Recommended Practice

It is recommended that the coupler type be a **KADEE** style coupler.
All couplers will be checked for free movement and the centering spring
should be fully functional.

***EXCEPTION:*** Trains that operate as a single unit, such as passenger
trains, may utilize any coupler type available, since interaction with
other cars will not occur.

## Coupler Height: Recommended Practice

All cars will be checked on the test track prior to placing them on the
layout. The test track will have **KADEE** coupler height gauges to
verify proper coupler height. Cars not meeting the proper height may not
be approved for operation on the layout. The test track will be provided
by the club.

## Car Weight: Recommended Practice

Cars should be weighted according to the **NMRA** recommended practice
**RP-20.1.**

Portions of **RP-20.1** are reprinted here:


| SCALE | Initial Weight | Additional Weight Per Inch of Body Length |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| HO  | 1 ounce | + ½ ounce |

To figure the optimum weight of a given car, take measurements of the
car with a standard ruler. Multiply the length of the car in inches by
.5 and then add 1. This will be the optimum weight of the car. If the
car is light weight add the difference in lead weights until desired
weight is achieved.

*EXAMPLE:*

A 50 ft car weighs *2* ounces and the car is roughly *7"* long. The
optimum weight is figured as follow: 7x.5 (*3.5*) ,+1 (*4.5*), -2
(*2.5*) The difference between the initial car weight (*2*) and the
optimum weight (*4.*5) is *2.5* and it is the amount of weight to add to
the car.

# Command Control


## Command Control Overview

The **NMRA** Electrical Committee: Digital Command Control Working Group
has developed a set of standards and recommended practices that define
digital command control so that basic interchange of equipment can be
obtained between users of different manufacturers of digital command
control equipment.

Digital Command Control (**DCC**) is possible because of new advances in
electronics that allow a very smart controller to be installed inside
the average locomotive shell. Instead of using a variable power source
as in the case of a standard analog throttle, the track becomes a
communications device that broadcasts multiple signals from many
controllers at once. Each locomotive receiver is pre-programmed to
respond to a specific controller, allowing many locomotives on the same
section of track, each controlled independently.

The analog throttle we commonly refer to as a *power pack* is now inside
the locomotive. As a result, the track will always have between 7 and 20
volts available across it when measured with a voltmeter. While most
non-decoder equipped locomotives will operate with this system, **NGM**
cannot guarantee that damage will not result from this use.

The **DCC** standard allows compatibility between different
manufacturers while at the same time allowing the manufacturer a great
deal of freedom and flexibility to create very different products to
fill market niches that they feel best qualified to provide.

**North Georgia Modurail, Inc**. has enthusiastically adopted these
standards by purchasing command stations, boosters, decoders and
throttles from **Digitrax, Inc**. of Norcross, Georgia. **Digitrax**
units are compatible with **NMRA** **DCC** Standards and Recommended
Practices[^14], while still offering additional options and features.

[^14]: Due to standardization, decoders from other **DCC** compatible
    manufacturers will work with the club system but extended optional
    features may not operate.

## Command Control Bus Wiring

It is strongly recommended that all new **NGM** modules provide support
for the Throttle Bus. If the module owner would like, **NGM** will
install a socket mounted RJ11-6 jack on either/both the north and/or
south faces of the module along with the associated wiring to interface
to the Throttle Bus.

### Power Pack Isolation

Sections of track that will operate in analog mode (using a standard
power pack), should provide some form of isolation. The most common
technique is to install a \#1156 30W, 12V automotive tail lamp between
adjoining track sections (*see diagram **D-5***.)

## Command Control Terms and Definitions

The purpose of this section is to define the nomenclature used in
discussing Digital Command Control (**DCC**). **DCC** can be assumed to
imply compatibility with **NMRA DCC** Standards and Recommended
Practices.

### Control Bus

A bus which connects a Command Station to its Boosters.

### Cab Bus

A bus used to connect all types of cabs, except wireless cabs, to a
command station. Wireless cabs are indirectly connected to a cab bus via
their companion wireless cab base.

### Booster

A unit which accepts as input a signal from a command station and
provides as output a power source onto which is encoded a digital
(**DCC**) packet signal. (Also known as a "Power Station". **Digitrax**
calls it a **DB100**, for example.) More than one booster may be used on
the same layout if additional current is needed for locomotives.

### Cab

A unit which presents to a human operator the controls necessary to
operate a model locomotive, track switches, or layout accessories. Such
controls may include both input devices (knobs, buttons, switches)and
output devices (lamps, displays, audible sounding units).

### Fixed Cab

A cab which is permanently mounted in a specific location.

### Tethered Cab

A cab which is hand-held and connected by a fixed cable to the layout.

### Walk-around Cab

A cab which is hand-held and connected by a cable to a plug which may be
inserted in jacks at multiple points around the layout. Walk-around cabs
permit the locomotive(s) being controlled by that cab to maintain
direction and speed during the interval while the cab is unplugged,
moved to a new location, and re-plugged. This is because packet
transmission is done in the command station.

### Wireless Cab

A hand-held cab which has no cable connection to the layout. Wireless
cabs may use infra-red, radio, or other means of communicating
information.

### Wireless Cab Base

A companion receptor unit for one or more wireless cabs which is fixed
to the layout and presents cab information to the cab bus

### Computerized Cab

A cab which is implemented by a personal computer or workstation.

### Panel or Tower Cab

A fixed cab which is primarily used for operating turnouts, signals, and
related track accessories. A tower cab may, but typically does not, also
control locomotives. Tower panels typically include display devices for
indicating track switch positions, track occupancy, and layout status. A
**CTC** board is an example of a tower cab.

### Command Station

That unit which *accepts* input from all cabs currently in use and
provides as output either:

1.  a **DCC** signal directly to the track, or
2.  an appropriate signal to drive a Booster to output a **DCC** signal.

### Software Command Station

A command station implemented by software processes in a computer,
typically a personal computer or workstation.

### Accessory Booster

A Booster whose output is dedicated to the operation of stationary
decoders.

### Programmer

That unit which provides access to the system configuration functions,
such as setting locomotive addresses, combining and breaking up multiple
unit lashups, etc. May be integrated with the command station, or with
one or more cabs.

### Decoder

A unit which accepts address and command information presented in the
digital packet format from a Command Station or Booster and directly
controls and drives a motor, solenoid, relay, lamp, or other device.
(Also known as a "Receiver".)

### Mobile Decoder

A decoder which is installed in, and implements the specific functions
to drive the motor, lamps, and accessories of a locomotive or other
piece of rolling stock. A mobile decoder derives its signal and power
from contact with the rails.

### Stationary Decoder

A decoder which is installed in a fixed place on the layout and provides
power and position control for one or more turnout motors or provides
operational control for other stationary accessories on the layout. A
stationary decoder may derive its signal and power from the rails or it
may be powered from an Accessory Booster.

### Decoder Slave

A unit which is driven by a decoder and which provides additional power
for the operation of additional electrical load in parallel with the
original decoder load. Typical use is for 2^nd^, 3^rd^, etc. motors in a
multi-motor locomotive or permanently-coupled locomotives. May also be
called "Slave Decoder".

### Track Segment

That portion of electrically isolated track powered and controlled by a
single Booster.

### Bus

A set of wires that distributes electrical power or signals around the
layout.

### Track Bus

A bus which connects a power station to a track segment. The aggregate
length of the track segment is limited such that the power station can
power the maximum number of locomotives to be simultaneously operated on
the segment. Note that stationary decoders may be connected to a track
bus. The wire gauge of a track bus must be appropriate to the rating of
the associated Booster.

# Definitions

The following items define the terms used in this document

## AWG

AWG refers to "American Wire Gauge". It is a standard that defines
electrical wire sizes by a numerical value. The word "***gauge***" is
commonly used when referring to a wire size.

**For the technical types:**, 14 gauge wire is 1.628 mm in diameter and
has the ability to conduct 17 amps of electrical current while only
having 2 ohms or resistance per 1000 feet.

## Auxiliary Track

Auxiliary lines serve as an optional third mainline when possible. When
used as a mainline, it must be installed with the same standards as the
other mainlines. An auxiliary track is always parallel to the mainline
at a 2 ½" center from mainline \#2 and is also called Mainline \#3. When
used as a siding, branch line standards apply and it may not be
considered as a third mainline if it deviates from the mainline
standard.

## Branch Lines

These lines are optional on all modules. They must conform to all
**NGM** electrical and interface standards. They must also be insulated
from the mainline if a local analog throttle is to be used while the
mainline is active.

## Bridge Track

A connecting, removable track section used to join the tracks between
modules. The interface area has been sized to allow standard sectional
track parts to be inserted between modules. *(Also known as an Interface
Track.)*

## Center Spacing

The distance between the centerlines of parallel tracks.

## Conforming Modules

Modules that are freely interchangeable in every way with all other
conforming modules built to these standards. Conformity shall be
determined by the **NGM** Conformance Committee.

## DCC

**Digital Command Control (DCC)**. The **NGM** standard incorporates
**NMRA** approved standards for **DCC** operation . **DCC** allows for
independent selection and control of engines by sending commands over
the rails to miniature microprocessors installed in the engine bodies.
The **NGM** electrical standard requires a telephone style jack to
connect the hand-held controller.

## East End

This is the right-hand end of the module as seen from the front (the
normal viewing side)

## West End

This is the left-hand end of the module as seen from the front (the
normal viewing side.)

## Interface Area

Any portion of the module within 1½" from the East and West ends of the
module. *(See the Interface Area diagram.)* The Interface Area is
considerably restricted by the **NMRA** and **NGM** standards to ensure
that modules are interchangeable and operations are smooth. The **NMRA**
standard defines the Interface Area to be 4½" vs. the 1½" adopted by
**NGM**.

## Mainline Track

The standard defines the mainline as two tracks running the length of
the module, not including the interface area, that provide eastbound and
westbound operation of trains. The mainline is restricted to 5" and 7"
centerlines from the front of the module (in the interface area) with
some optional variations. The mainline also has strict radius, grade and
turnout restrictions to ensure smooth operation.

## Mated Set

Any group of modules in which the individual modules *cannot* be used
separately for some reason. Mated Sets typically consist of modules that
do not conform to our interface standards between themselves, but
conform to the interface standards at both ends of the set.

A variation of a mated set is a group of modules that fully conform to
our interface standards but are designed to be joined together due to
scene continuity or optional interface area track connections that
provide multi module continuity. *(Commonly seen in intermodal yard
modules.)*

## Module

A module is a portable section of a table-like frame work which is one
part of a large group of similar modules that when assembled together
forms a large and fully operating model railroad. They are built by
individuals as part of a home layout or specifically for interfacing
with others in a large setup. All are built to a set of standards that
allow each unit to interface exactly with other units anywhere in the
overall system. A module may be a single frame or a set of frames that
interface with other modules in a standard manner but that may deviate
from the interface standard between ends (*see Interface Area.*) By
being portable, they may be disassembled-assembled for transporting to
conventions or public displays. Many clubs are formed for the specific
purpose of building module layouts as space for permanent layouts is
hard to find and very expensive when available. **NGM** is such a club.

## Non-Conforming Module

Modules that are not built to these standards (in either track
arrangement or electrical wiring methods) and therefore not directly
compatible with the system as outlined here.

## Non-Interface Area

Any portion of the module not within the interface area. Restrictions
within the non-interface area are minimal, although extreme variations
in grade, turn radius, and track gauge could render the module
undesirable.

## Route Convention

The southern most mainline (mainline \#1) runs eastward and the next
parallel mainline runs westward. The auxiliary mainline direction is not
defined. **NOTE:** The viewing side of the module is the south side.
