# Dispatching Basics
1. On arrival, check in with the designated '*Dispatcher*'[^DISP1] *before* placing anything on a setup table or the layout anywhere. Ask the dispatcher what information s/he needs to approve your '*block occupancy grant request*'. Usually, you will need to provideâ€¦

  * Consist information
  
  * Which yard block you wish to set up on (occupy) and which track block you wish to operate on.
  
  * How much time you need to set up and be ready to occupy the next block (track).

2. After the dispatcher approves your request, you may begin building your consist.

3. Notify the dispatcher anytime you want to move to a different block (e.g., yard to main track or vice versa). Wait for the dispatcher to approve the request before making the move.

6. Follow the general **Operating Guidelines and 'Rules of the Road'** and enjoy operating your train!

[^DISP1]: Depending on the event, this may be the '*Trainmaster*' and/or a '*Yardmaster*'. For simplicity, '*Dispatcher*' here may refer to any or all of these roles.

# Extras
1. Block grants apply to all engines and rolling stock anywhere on the layout including yards and service facility tracks.

2. You **must** notify the dispatcher if you expect to have an *unattended* consist on the layout (e.g., a meal break) and you **must** get a valid block grant for it. The dispatcher must know how to contact you.

3. The setup tables do not require a block grant. However, please remove your boxes after setup or *risk having them removed for you*.

4. Nothing is to be left on the layout overnight without permission from the dispatcher, and that only in rare circumstances.[^DISP2]

[^DISP2]: The only exception is personally owned modules with sidings.
