# Overview
This summary document is an abbreviated version of the complete **Dispatching Protocols** document. Refer to that document for more specific details.

When using the NGM layout to run trains (operator) or even as a static display of engines or rolling stock during an exhibit or operating session, please follow these simple steps to ensure all members can enjoy our shared resources.

# Dispatching Basics
1. On arrival, check in with the designated dispatcher[^DISP1] *before* placing anything on a setup table or the layout anywhere (including the yards and steam or diesel servicing facility tracks).

2. Find out about any special instructions, operating direction, restrictions, and general dispatching guidelines in effect for the event. Dispatchers have some leeway in how they work and which tools they prefer to use.

3. Ask the dispatcher what information s/he needs to approve your '*block occupancy grant request*'. Usually, you will need to provide…

  * Consist information (lead engine road name, type, number, DCC address and general consist description).
  
  * Which yard block you wish to set up on (occupy) and which track block you wish to operate on (the dispatcher may advise which one is best).
  
  * How much time you need to set up and be ready to occupy the next block (track).

4. The dispatcher will either approve your *block grant request* (usually) or postpone the grant to a later time. A valid block grant will have a starting time and an ending time (expiration). It will essentially record the '*who, what, where, when and for how long?*' of any consist on the layout. You **may not** continue to occupy a block after the grant expires, though you may request a reasonable extension of the expiration from the dispatcher.

5. Notify the dispatcher anytime you need/want to move to a different block (e.g. yard to main track or vice versa). This simply creates a new block grant that supersedes the previous grant. Wait for the dispatcher to approve the grant request before making the move.

6. Follow the general **Operating Guidelines and 'Rules of the Road'**  and enjoy operating your train!

[^DISP1]: Depending on the event, this may be the '*Trainmaster*' and/or a '*Yardmaster*'. For simplicity, '*dispatcher*' here may refer to any or all of these roles.

# Extras
A few other things to keep in mind…

1. Block grants apply to all engines and rolling stock anywhere on the layout (except your personal module siding tracks). Do not place *anything* on the steam or diesel servicing facility tracks without a valid block grant.

2. You **must** notify the dispatcher if you expect to have an *unattended* consist on the layout (e.g. a meal break) and you **must** get a valid block grant for it. The dispatcher must know how to contact you.

3. The setup tables do not require a block grant. However, please remove your boxes after setup or *risk having them removed for you*.

4. Nothing is to be left on the layout overnight without permission from the dispatcher, and that only in rare circumstances.[^DISP2]

[^DISP2]: The only exception is personally owned modules with sidings.
