#Purpose
North Georgia Modurail[^NGM1] (NGM) has a long history of providing its Members an opportunity to enjoy model railroading in a group environment. As with any group, there are often conflicts over shared resources or differing opinions and values. These guidelines are intended to minimize these conflicts while maximizing our Members' mutual enjoyment of the hobby during NGM sponsored events.

These are *not* intended to be a comprehensive set of strict rules (how much fun would that be?) but merely reflect the accumulated wisdom of a shared culture. Courtesy and good judgment are the overriding themes for these guidelines.

#Mainline Operations
* Check in with the Trainmaster[^OP1] upon arrival for clearance to setup and operate.[^OP2]

* **Never program your DCC locomotive while on the layout.** Use only the programming track (separate from the layout).

* To prevent accidents, derailments, or damage, return track switches to the mainline position after your train passes through. This may be one switch or multiple switches.

* Check with other operators before entering or crossing the mainlines.

* Notify the Trainmaster and other operators if you or another train has stopped on the mainline or need to slow down.

* If your train experiences continued technical or mechanical difficulties, notifiy the Trainmaster and remove the train from the mainline for repairs. Never leave a train parked on the main.

* Train loading and off-loading should take place in the yard(s) only.

* Watch your speed.

* Use metal wheelsets on the layout.

[^OP1]: This may refer to the Yardmaster and/or the Dispatcher, depending on the show.
[^OP2]: Refer to the Dispatching document supplement for more details.

#Yards
* The club yards offer limited space for *active* loading and unloading trains. Generally, trains should not be parked in the yards without permission from the Yardmaster.

* The Yardmaster oversees traffic flow and keeps the yards clear for arrivals and departures.

#Other Protocols
* If you operate trains at a show, you are expected to help with show setup, tear-down, and loading the club trailer. While no one can help every time, this is an important part of club membership.

* Members are encouraged to build a module and use it in shows. Quality scenery, trackwork, and reliable wiring are all important. Club members are always happy to help with module options.

* Members have invested in fine HO locomotives and rolling stock, or may have intricate award-winning scenery that took weeks to build. Be respectful of tools, trains, modules, and scenery that belong to other members. Don't move or operate another member's train without permission, and don't leave your train on someone's module without their permission.

* Club members may allow a guest to operate on the layout only under the continuous supervision of that member. **No exceptions.**

* Tracks can become crowded at some events. Be aware of your time on the track and consider giving others an opportunity to run.

* The Trainmaster and Show Coordinator oversee general operations, etiquette, and reliability of trains on the layout. The Trainmaster, Show Coordinator and Board Members may remove unreliable trains and operators in violation of the "Rules of the Road" in order to keep the event enjoyable for everyone.

* Model railroading is a great hobby that attracts people of all ages, backgrounds, and experience levels.

* We encourage NGM members to become join the National Model Railroad Association (NMRA). The local chapter of NMRA is the Piedmont Division which covers metro Atlanta and most of North Georgia.
