# Purpose
This document supplements the **NGM Operating Protocols and 'Rules of the Road'** document with more specific information on train operations and dispatching.

* Since its beginning in 1993, NGM has always expected train operators to run at the direction of a Dispatcher. While this expectation has not always been strictly adhered to, it should be considered a normal way to *'run a railroad'*.

* This document seeks to clarify these expectations and introduce some new terminology.

* Following these protocols will give NGM members and visitors alike a more enjoyable model railroading experience.

# Dispatching Protocols
In general, dispatching a railroad (prototype or model) means that *all* traffic on the railroad (whether moving or not) is monitored and directed by a *'Dispatcher'*[^DISP1].

* The dispatcher's *'Order Board'* should reflect what is actually happening on the railroad. Which trains are where, why and for how long?

* To properly maintain the NGM order board, the designated dispatcher will approve a request (give permission) for a train (consist) to *'occupy a block'* for a certain period of time.

* This approval is called a *'Track Authority'* (*TA* for short).

* A *'block'* is any section of track under the direction of the dispatcher and/or the yardmaster. For typical NGM layouts for public exhibits, blocks would be mainline tracks (main 1, main 2 and aux. 3) and all yard tracks (main and wye yards, and the diesel and steam servicing facilities).

  + A block may also include a siding if its control has been ceded to the dispatcher by the siding owner.
  
  + Special operating sessions may call for defining blocks differently (such as a subdivided mainline).
  
  + Remote (AKA *foreign*) track areas controlled by other groups or individuals with modules connected to an NGM layout are usually not considered dispatcher controlled blocks.

* The TA issued by the dispatcher is only valid for the time period approved by the TA (start and end times noted on the order board). The dispatcher may not issue *'indefinite'* or *'permanent'* TAs.

* The dispatcher issues a TA for a specific operator and *'consist'*. If either or both of these change, there must be a new TA.

* Operators **must** request and receive permission from the dispatcher **before**…

  1. placing any rolling stock (engines or cars) anywhere on the layout[^DISP2],
  2. moving from one block to another block (e.g., entering a yard from a mainline or vice versa),
  3. leaving a controlled block to go to a remote (foreign) track section or returning from same,
  4. making significant changes[^DISP3] to the approved consist,
  5. removing a consist from a designated block.

[^DISP1]: In most cases, NGM will only have one person designated as the *'Dispatcher'* and may be referred to as the *'Trainmaster'* and also serve as the *'Yardmaster'*. Usually, these terms are used interchangeably.

[^DISP2]: This includes *all* mainline tracks, including aux. 3. The only exception is on personally owned module sidings and tracks, which are not considered dispatcher controlled blocks.

[^DISP3]: Removing or replacing a few 'problem' cars is not significant. Changing the lead engine or the general consist 'type' to a different type *is* significant (e.g., change a mixed general freight consist to mostly coal hoppers). The dispatcher must be able to visually verify the order board matches what's on the layout.

# FAQ


## Why are we changing?
We didn't have to request *TAs* before, why now?

**A.** Despite recent club history, operating trains on the club layout was always supposed to be under the direction of a dispatcher. These protocols aren't a change so much as a clarification and more consistent enforcement of the club's dispatching protocols.

  * Any NGM layout is a limited resource, regardless of how big it is. The main yard only has seven usable tracks (one is supposed to be reserved for a through track). The other yard tracks also have limited storage capacity. Even the largest layout can only accommodate a limited number of operating consists per track (effectively two mainlines).

  * With sometimes dozens of members who want to run trains, the best way to allocate the limited resource is through dispatch TAs.
  
  * Most TAs will be approved. Very rarely will the dispatcher need to deny or postpone a request.
  
  * Recent experience with an active dispatcher proves that the setup yards (main and wye) can be kept clear enough for new consists to be be built and running consists to come off if a yardmaster/dispatcher can direct traffic.
  
  * NGM can eliminate *'unknown consists'* (*'orphans'*) from clogging up the yards.
  
  * The club can provide significantly better member and guest experiences.

## What is a *'block'*?
**A.** A *'block'* is any section of track on the club layout under the control of the yardmaster and/or the dispatcher. These include *all* yard tracks (main and wye yards as well as the diesel and steam servicing facilities) and the three mainline tracks (main 1, main 2 and aux. 3). These may also include *'sidings'* on personal modules as the module owner may decide.

  * For most public exhibits, a mainline block is usually the entirety of a particular track (e.g., main track 2). In a dedicated operating session, a track or yard may be further subdivided into smaller blocks for operational purposes (as on a protoype railroad).

* Blocks will usually have multiple consists operating in them at the same time. (See footnote on *non-exclusive* in the Track Authority section.)

## What is a *'consist'*?
**A.** A *'consist'* is any set of cars (*'rolling stock'*) of any length, from a single car or engine to a string of cars with or without motive power.

## What is a *'Track Authority'*?
**A.** A *'Track Authority'* (*'TA'*) is a non-exclusive[^DISP4], limited time *permission to occupy a block* by one or more engines or cars (consist). A TA has a starting and ending time (expiration).

  * The start time begins when the yardmaster/dispatcher *'grants'* the operator authority (approves the request) to occupy a specific block with a specific consist.

  * The end time (*'TA expiration'*) is simply when the permission expires. The operator **must** request permission to either extend the TA, move and occupy a different block or completely remove the consist from the layout. For example, the operator requests to enter the main yard block from the mainline track 1 block. The dispatcher/yardmaster will create a new *'TA'* for this move.

  * No TA may be issued without an expiration. **There are no indefinite or permanent grants to occupy any block.**

[^DISP4]:*Non-exlusive' means the operator may be sharing the TA block with other operators and must exercise caution and courtesy when operating within their block.

## How do I request a TA?
**A.** Simply contact the designated dispatcher or yardmaster and ask permission to occupy a block. S/he will advise what information is needed to approve the TA. For example…

  * ID of the consist (*'This is Amtrak #2890 with a passenger consist of 6 cars.'*),

  * Which block and for how long (*'May I occupy the wye yard for 10 minutes to set up my train?'*, or *'May I occupy main track 2 and run for 45 minutes?'*),

  * DCC address (*'I'm operating on DCC address 2890.'*)

## What are *'remote blocks'*?
**A.** Occasionally, NGM collaborates with other clubs or groups to build larger layouts. A *'remote block'* is any track section not under the control or direction of the NGM dispatcher (AKA *'foreign'* territory). These remote blocks are not considered NGM mainline, yard or siding blocks. Nevertheless, an operator with a valid mainline TA should advise the dispatcher when leaving the NGM mainline and request a new TA to re-enter the NGM mainline. These remote blocks may or may not require TAs to enter their blocks.

## What does the *'Dispatcher'* do?
**A.** The *'Dispatcher'* is primarily responsible for the efficient movement of trains on the layout, in particular the mainline tracks (main 1, main 2 and aux. 3). During public exhibits, s/he will ensure that our guests and visitors will see plenty of *'train action'* and maximize the capacity of the layout while maintaining safe operating distance between trains. To accomplish this s/he will be responsible to…

  * approve or deny (sometimes postone) TA requests,

  * continually monitor mainline traffic and adjust TAs as needed,

  * update the dispatching tool (digital or analog) to reflect current track and layout conditions,

  * make decisions about running direction (right- or left-hand),

  * advise operators of passing moves (sidings or using the aux. 3 track),

  * advise operators of unsafe operating practices (e.g., excessive speed), removal of *'problem'* cars and anything else needed for a good experience by our guests and other members,

  * *have explicit authority* to safely move (or remove) *'orphan'*[^DISP4] cars, engines and entire consists from the layout,

  * communicate with the *'Yardmaster'* to efficiently hand off TA requests.

During most NGM exhibits, the Dispatcher and Yardmaster duties will be shared by the same individual.

[^DISP4]: Any rolling stock or consist occupying any dispatcher controlled block without a valid TA and whose owner cannot be identified or is not present is considered *'orphaned'* and is subject to removal.

## What does the *'Yardmaster'* do?
**A.** The *'Yardmaster'* is responsible for the efficient use of the yard tracks. These include the main yard, the diesel and steam servicing facilities and the wye yard (AKA Ivan's yard). S/he will be responsible to…

  * approve or deny (sometimes postone) TA requests to occupy yard tracks,

  * continually monitor yard track usage to ensure all consists have valid (current) TAs,

  * approve or deny requests to occupy yard tracks while consists are *'unattended'* (lunch breaks, etc.),

  * update the dispatching tool (digital or analog) to reflect current yard conditions,

  * *have explicit authority* to safely move (or remove) *'orphan'* cars, engines and entire consists from the yards,

   * ensure the setup tables remain clear, be responsible to keep them clear and may safely move anything which is not being used for *active* setup or take off,
  
  * communicate with the Dispatcher to efficiently hand off TA requests.

During most NGM exhibits, the Dispatcher and Yardmaster duties will be shared by the same individual.

## What are *'sidings'*?
**A.** *'Sidings'* are any sections of track not part of the mainline tracks (main 1, main 2 or aux. 3) or designated shared yards.

  * In most cases, siding tracks are on personally owned modules. As such, only the module owner may place or leave consists on their sidings without needing a TA from the dispatcher.

  * The module owner may cede control of these sidings to the dispatcher, in which case siding occupancy must be approved by the dispatcher by a *'siding TA'*.

  * Sidings **may not** be used for passing moves or temporary storage without express permission from the module owner or the dispatcher.

## What about my Signup Genius slot?
I signed up for an operations slot on Signup Genius (SUG). Do I still have to ask for an operating slot (TA) during the show?

**A.** Yes, the SUG form is used to ensure the coordination team has enough committed participants for each time slot. By itself, it does *not* create a *'TA'*. However, signing up *may* provide a TA priority in case of excess demand.

## May I have multiple consists on the layout at the same time?
**A.** Usually not, and always with an approved TA from the dispatcher/yardmaster. Typical exceptions might be solo engines (sometimes other rolling stock) temporarily left in the diesel or steam facility yards. Even for these exceptions, there are no *'indefinite'* TAs. These must be removed when the TA expires or another TA is requested (move to another block or extend the TA).

## What about breaks?
Do I have to remove my consist from the layout to take a meal break?

**A.** Usually not, though it depends on a variety of factors and the dispatcher/yardmaster will make the ultimate decision. However, the consist operator **must** request and recieve a valid TA for the expected duration of the break. The operator must not leave any consist unattended for any significant length of time and will ensure the yardmaster knows how to contact them.

  * This protocol includes leaving any consist(s) (including single cars and engines) on any part of the layout overnight. These extended TAs are strongly discouraged and should only be approved in very limited circumstances.
